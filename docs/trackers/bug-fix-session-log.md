# Session Log — Bug-Fix Work Stream

> **Scope:** Multi-session work to close the OPEN bugs in `docs/issues/`.
> Started 2026-05-17 when the controller began scouting the 4 open buffer/markdown
> bugs filed 2026-05-09. F-N entries capture drift between bug-file Resume hints
> and current code reality; W-N entries capture practices that prevented wasted
> fix work.


> **Purpose:** Two-sided observation log for a multi-session work stream.
> Captures frictions (F-N) and wins (W-N) that the session producing it
> wants to preserve so future sessions inherit the lesson.
>
> **How to use:** Copy this file to `docs/trackers/<topic>-session-log.md`
> in the active project on first reconnaissance pass. Append F-N / W-N
> entries via `edit_markdown(action="insert_before", heading="## Template
> for new entries", content=...)`. Add a row to the Index / Wins Index
> table for each new entry — the indexes are the eval surface, the
> sections are the evidence.
>
> **Lifecycle:**
> - Created at the start of a multi-session work stream.
> - Appended-to across every session that touches the work.
> - Entries with `Status: open` carry forward across sessions.
> - Promotion to permanent surfaces (CLAUDE.md, ADRs, formal bug
>   trackers) happens when the entry's `Promote-when` / `Fix idea`
>   criteria fire.
> - File archived (moved to `docs/trackers/archive/`) when the work
>   stream wraps.

## Category conventions

Use a short kebab-case category to group similar frictions. Prior
sessions have used:

| Category | When to use |
|---|---|
| `codescout-tool` | Friction in a codescout MCP tool (`grep`, `read_file`, `edit_markdown`, etc.) |
| `subagent` | Subagent produced unexpected output or diverged from instructions |
| `plan-prose` | Plan document had drift vs reality (wrong file paths, fictional code, mismatched counts) |
| `architectural` | Discovered structural property of the system that the plan / docs didn't surface |
| `self-friction` | Predicted a friction that turned out to be a false alarm — recorded for transparency |
| `<language>-<library>` | Language- / library-specific footgun (`rust-serde`, `python-typing`) |
| `release-pipeline` | Deployment-time gap (release binary missing, MCP reload needed, etc.) |

Add a new category by writing it as a kebab-case string; no central registry needed.

## F-N entry template

Copy this block when appending a new friction. Allocate the next free
ID. Add a matching row to the Index table.

```markdown
## F-N — <one-line title>

**Observed:** <date, session task>

**When:** <what you were trying to do>

**Expected:** <what plan / docs / prior session said>

**Got:** <actual observed reality>

**Probable cause:** <one sentence>

**Workaround:** <what you did to proceed>

**Severity:** low | med | high

**Status:** open | wontfix-false-alarm | fixed-verified | mitigated | promoted-to-bug-tracker | pinned-as-eval-baseline

**Fix idea / Pointer:** <issue # in formal tracker, plan task ID, or "TBD">

---
```

## W-N entry template

Copy this block when appending a new win. A win without a
**Counterfactual** is marketing — name what would have happened
without the pattern, with at least one piece of evidence.

```markdown
## W-N — <one-line title>

**Observed:** <date, session task>

**Pattern:** <the practice that worked>

**Counterfactual:** <what would have happened without the pattern, with evidence>

**Confirming data points:** <list of session moments validating the pattern; aim for ≥2>

**Impact:** low | med | high

**Promote-when:** <criterion for graduating into permanent docs (CLAUDE.md, ADR, etc.)>

**Status:** validated | promoted-to-permanent-docs | archived

## Status vocabulary

Codified so the Index column means the same thing across sessions.

### Friction statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `open` | Observed, not yet resolved. Default for new entries. |
| `wontfix-false-alarm` | Initial observation was wrong; documented for transparency rather than deleted. |
| `mitigated` | Workaround in place; root cause not fully resolved. |
| `fixed-verified` | Code / process fix landed AND empirically confirmed. (`fixed` alone is too weak — verification is part of the status.) |
| `promoted-to-bug-tracker` | Moved to a formal tracker (`docs/issues/*`, `docs/TODO-*`, GitHub issue). The session log keeps the pointer; the formal tracker owns the lifecycle. |
| `pinned-as-eval-baseline` | Kept verbatim as a reference point for measuring later improvements. Do NOT close — its job is to remain comparable. |

### Win statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `validated` | Pattern confirmed by ≥1 counterfactual data point. Default for entries with evidence. |
| `promoted-to-permanent-docs` | Moved into CLAUDE.md, an ADR, a skill, or another permanent surface. Session log keeps the pointer. |
| `archived` | Pattern no longer load-bearing — either the underlying system changed or the discipline became automatic. |

## F-1 — Bug-file Resume paths cite non-existent layout

**Observed:** 2026-05-17, scouting `docs/issues/2026-05-09-*.md` to start fix work.

**When:** First `symbols(path)` calls after reading the 4 OPEN bug files.

**Expected:** Bug-file Resume sections cited `src/tools/buffer/handlers.rs` and `src/tools/search/grep.rs` as the starting points.

**Got:** `path not found: src/tools/buffer/` and `path not found: src/tools/search/grep.rs`. Real layout: `src/tools/output_buffer.rs`, `src/tools/read_file.rs` (with `read_from_buffer` helper inside), `src/tools/grep.rs` (top-level — no `search/` subdir).

**Probable cause:** Module restructure between 2026-05-09 (when bugs filed) and 2026-05-17 (current session). Bug files are append-only and never refresh path hints when the layout shifts.

**Workaround:** Ran `tree(src/tools)` to discover the real layout, then proceeded from `read_from_buffer`, `Grep::call`, `extract_lines`, `extract_json_path`.

**Severity:** low

**Status:** fixed-verified

**Fix idea / Pointer:** Resume sections for the 3 closed bug files (`grep-buffer-false-negatives`, `read-file-buffer-midpoint-empty`, `read-file-json-path-array-elements`) were rewritten in the same session to cite real symbols (`Grep::call`, `extract_lines` at `src/util/text.rs:23-33`, `extract_json_path` at `src/tools/file_summary/file_summary.rs:419`). Bug #1 (`edit-markdown-insert-after-h1`) still cites `src/tools/markdown/edit_markdown.rs` which is a real path — not affected.

---

## F-2 — 2 of 3 buffer bugs likely stale; code reads correct

**Observed:** 2026-05-17, reading `extract_lines` + `extract_json_path` bodies before writing fixes.

**When:** Investigating root causes for `2026-05-09-read-file-buffer-midpoint-empty.md` and `2026-05-09-read-file-json-path-array-elements.md`.

**Expected:** Per bug-file hypotheses, expected to find chunk-walker not advancing (`#3`) and array-index json_path mishandled (`#4`).

**Got:**
- `extract_lines` (12 lines, `src/util/text.rs:21-33`) — trivially correct line-range filter with existing passing test `extract_lines_out_of_bounds_returns_empty`. No chunk-walker exists.
- `extract_json_path` (`src/tools/file_summary/file_summary.rs:419`) — handles array indexing + has passing test `extract_json_path_array_index` using `$.users[0]`. Comment in code explicitly cites `$.symbols[0].body` as a working case.

**Probable cause:** Either (a) intervening commit closed the bugs without crediting back the bug files, or (b) original reporter observed empty STRING value at the json path (correct return) and misread it as "broken." `Bug #2` (`grep-buffer-false-negatives`) IS real — `Grep::call` has no `@*` ref handling at all.

**Workaround:** Plan to write probe tests mirroring the exact bug-file reproductions. If they pass: close as `wontfix-false-alarm` + commit the test as a regression guard. If they fail: real defect surfaces.

**Severity:** med

**Status:** fixed-verified

**Fix idea / Pointer:** Probe tests confirmed prediction:
- Bug #2 `grep-buffer-false-negatives` FAILED probe → confirmed real → fixed via `grep_in_buffer` + `@`-prefix branch in `Grep::call`.
- Bug #3 `read-file-buffer-midpoint-empty` PASSED probe → closed `wontfix`, test kept as regression pin.
- Bug #4 `read-file-json-path-array-elements` PASSED probe → closed `wontfix`, test kept as regression pin.

## W-1 — Scout helper-fn bodies before "fixing" reported bugs

**Observed:** 2026-05-17, bug-fix work stream kickoff.

**Pattern:** Read the `extract_lines` and `extract_json_path` bodies before writing any failing test or any fix. Each was small (~12 / ~50 lines) and surfaced its own correctness immediately.

**Counterfactual:** Without reading the helper-fn bodies first, would have written either (a) instrumentation patches to "debug" non-existent chunk-walker bugs in `extract_lines`, or (b) a "fix" adding array indexing to `extract_json_path` that already exists and is tested. Both = wasted commits + churn on green code. Concrete evidence: bug-file hypothesis "Buffer is chunked internally and the chunk-walker may not advance past the first chunk" was confidently wrong — there is no chunk walker.

**Confirming data points:**
1. `extract_lines` body reveals no chunk walker exists — bug-file hypothesis #3 invalidated in one read.
2. `extract_json_path_array_index` test (passing, `$.users[0]`) invalidates bug-file hypothesis #4 in one read.
3. By contrast, scouting `Grep::call` confirmed bug #2 is real — same scouting move found one true defect among three claimed defects.
4. Probe tests for #3 and #4 passed immediately, proving the prediction; probe test for #2 failed with an explicit panic naming the failure mode (`relative path '@tool_*' requires an active project`), letting the fix shape itself.

**Impact:** med

**Promote-when:** This is a specific instance of the existing reconnaissance discipline. Already covered by `codescout-companion:reconnaissance` skill. No promotion needed — count this as a confirming data point for the skill, not a new rule.

**Status:** validated

## F-3 — Plan test assertions cited non-existent `RecoverableError.hint` field

**When:** Pre-dispatch reconnaissance for the jsonpath negative-slice
implementation plan (`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-18-jsonpath-negative-slice.md`).
About to dispatch Task 1 subagent.

**Expected (plan):** `RecoverableError` has accessible `.hint: Option<String>`
field; plan tests used `err.hint.as_deref().unwrap_or("")`.

**Got (scouted reality):** `RecoverableError` at `src/tools/core/types.rs:169`
exposes `pub message: String` and `pub guidance: Option<Guidance>` — there is
NO `.hint` field. There IS a method `.hint() -> Option<&str>` that returns the
text only for the `Guidance::Hint` variant. The `Display` impl's own comment
explicitly recommends `to_string().contains(...)` for test assertions because
it renders `"{message} — Hint: {text}"` and is the documented stable contract:

> "Display renders only `message`. The structured `hint` and `recovery_steps`
> are intentionally omitted here so existing `to_string().contains(...)` test
> assertions stay stable."

Wait — re-reading: Display renders `message` PLUS `" — {field_name}: {text}"`
when guidance is present. The contract is: `to_string().contains(hint_text)`
holds. So tests can use `err.to_string().contains("...")` regardless of which
guidance variant is attached.

**Probable cause:** Plan was written from the design spec; spec didn't pin
the assertion-side accessor shape; writing-plans phase didn't scout
`RecoverableError`. Standard "scout helper-fn bodies" rule (W-1 in this same
session log) applies to type shapes too.

**Workaround:** Edit the plan's Task 2 + Task 3 test code to use
`err.to_string().contains("...")` everywhere a hint-text or message-text
assertion is made. Drops the `.hint` field reference. Less brittle than
`err.message.contains(...)` because it also covers cases where the failing
substring lives in the guidance text rather than the message text.

**Severity:** med — would have caused first subagent's tests to fail to
compile; controller would then absorb the failed-task drift mid-dispatch.

**Status:** open → fixed-verified after plan edit lands this turn.
## W-2 — Pre-dispatch recon caught test-shape error before any subagent ran

**When:** About to dispatch Task 1 of the jsonpath negative-slice plan to a
fresh subagent (subagent-driven-development mode).

**Pattern:** Before the first subagent dispatch on a plan that names *types*
in test assertions (not just *fns*), invoke the reconnaissance skill and
scout each referenced type's actual field/method shape. Specifically:
`symbols(name=<TypeName>, include_body=true)` for any type whose accessors
the plan tests mention.

**Counterfactual:** Without this scout, Task 2's first subagent would have
written `err.hint.as_deref().unwrap_or("")` and failed `cargo check` on the
first parse test. The subagent would have flailed (probable retries with
`err.guidance`, or `err.hint().unwrap_or("")`, or `err.to_string()`) without
the Display-impl contract context. Best case: 1 extra round-trip per failing
test (~11 round-trips for the 11 parser tests in Task 2). Worst case: the
subagent gives up, controller re-scopes plan mid-dispatch, F-N entry written
*after* drift instead of *before*.

**Confirming data points:**
1. F-3 (this session) — `RecoverableError.hint` field cited by plan does not
   exist; scout caught it pre-dispatch.
2. Pending: any future plan that names types in assertions.

**Impact:** med — saves ≥1 failed subagent task and prevents controller
context absorption of cascading test failures. The saving compounds
across the 4 implementation tasks in the plan.

**Promote-when:** A second pre-dispatch recon catches a similarly hidden
type-shape mismatch (any plan, any type). At 2 datapoints, promote to
CLAUDE.md's "Before dispatching the first subagent of an implementation
plan, scout every type whose accessors the plan asserts on" rule.

**Status:** validated — single datapoint, drift caught + fixed in the same
turn before any subagent dispatch. Awaiting promotion criterion.
## F-4 — `edit_markdown action="replace"` with a heading argument clobbers the whole section body

**Observed:** 2026-05-18, while adding the "When the Substrate Catches Itself" section to `docs/observations.md`.

**When:** Tried to add a new H2 section after the existing `## The Plugin Closes the Loop` via `edit_markdown(action="replace", heading="## The Plugin Closes the Loop", content="<new section + trailing closer line>")` — expecting insert-after-like semantics.

**Expected:** `action="replace"` with `heading=X` would either replace only the heading line or operate on a localized region near the anchor.

**Got:** The full body of `## The Plugin Closes the Loop` (~30 lines of SessionStart / SubagentStart / PreToolUse hook narrative + the marketplace install hint) was overwritten wholesale with the new section's content. The original body was destroyed.

**Probable cause:** `edit_markdown action="replace"` with a `heading` argument has "set the body of this section to `content`" semantics. The argument is the section anchor, not an insertion anchor; the operation wipes from the heading's end through to the next sibling heading. Not aliased with `insert_after`.

**Workaround:** Caught by the Frog discipline's post-edit verify (`read_markdown` after every write). Reconstructed the original body from an earlier in-session `read_markdown` snapshot, ran `edit_markdown action="replace"` again with the original content to restore it, then `edit_markdown action="edit"` for cosmetic blank-line repairs. Three extra round-trips beyond the intended insert.

**Severity:** med — data loss within session, fully recovered, but easy to miss without verify-after-edit.

**Status:** promoted-to-bug-tracker (this session); see `docs/issues/2026-05-18-edit-markdown-replace-clobber.md`.

**Fix idea / Pointer:** `docs/issues/2026-05-18-edit-markdown-replace-clobber.md` carries the bug-tracker entry. Two fix options drafted there: (a) foreground the destructive scope in the tool description (lighter), (b) refuse `action="replace"` when `len(new) < 0.2 * len(old)` unless a `force=true` flag is set (substrate-level safety). Option (a) ships first; option (b) only if (a) doesn't reduce frequency.

## F-5 — HEAD detached from `experiments` without `git checkout` originating in this session

**Observed:** 2026-05-18, after several `/reload-plugins` calls + one `/mcp` reconnect cycle while working on observations.md.

**When:** Session started on `experiments` per the git status snapshot at the top of the system prompt. After multi-step work (tracker rectification, hook verification, observations.md edits), ran `git commit` for the observations work — output showed `[detached HEAD a70816b5]`, NOT `[experiments a70816b5]`.

**Expected:** `git checkout`-style branch detachment requires an explicit checkout call. Host operations (`/reload-plugins`, `/mcp` reconnect) and codescout MCP tool calls should leave HEAD on its current branch.

**Got:** `git reflog -15` revealed three unattributed HEAD moves between my last commit (`81a6d136`, on `experiments`) and the detached commit (`a70816b5`):
```
HEAD@{1}: checkout: moving from experiments to d5bf7116
HEAD@{2}: checkout: moving from 59f6b53c… to experiments
HEAD@{3}: checkout: moving from experiments to 59f6b53c
```
HEAD was actively bounced between `experiments` and parallel-session commit SHAs (the `feat(file_summary)` work the other session shipped). My session issued zero `git checkout` calls during that window.

**Probable cause:** Unknown. Candidates:
1. `codescout-companion` PostToolUse hook on `mcp__.*__workspace` (`cs-activate-project.sh` or `worktree-activate.sh`) running `git checkout` as a side effect.
2. Parallel session's commits propagating into shared workspace state in a way the host translates to a HEAD move on my side.
3. `/reload-plugins` re-running SessionStart-style hooks that touch git refs.

**Workaround:** Detected via the `[detached HEAD ...]` string in `git commit` output. Recovered via W-3 (`git merge --ff-only`). No data lost.

**Severity:** high — silent data-loss vector. Commits on detached HEAD are reachable only via reflog and expire on `git gc`. The user only sees the failure if they read the `git commit` output carefully — easy to miss.

**Status:** open — root cause unknown.

**Fix idea / Pointer:** Open a bug file with the reflog snippet preserved. Audit companion hooks that touch git state — likely candidates: `hooks/cs-activate-project.sh`, `hooks/worktree-activate.sh`, anything in the SessionStart hook chain. If a hook is moving HEAD as a side effect of workspace activation, scope it to only run when the active project itself changed, not on every reconnect.

---

## W-3 — `git merge --ff-only` as the atomic recovery primitive under concurrent-work HEAD detachment

**When:** 2026-05-18, recovering commit `a70816b5` (observations.md narrative) from detached HEAD after `/reload-plugins` + `/mcp` cycle silently moved HEAD to a parallel session's commit SHA (`d5bf7116`).

**Pattern:**
1. Read full state in a single command — `git reflog -15 && git branch -v && git rev-parse HEAD && git symbolic-ref HEAD` — so the observation set is internally consistent before any write.
2. Recover with `git checkout <target-branch> && git merge --ff-only <recovered-sha>` in a single command. The `--ff-only` flag is the atomic safety: it succeeds silently if `<recovered-sha>` is a strict descendant of the target branch's current tip (history is not fabricated, only the branch pointer moves), and it fails loudly if anything diverged between the read and the write.

**Counterfactual:** Naive recovery `git branch -f experiments a70816b5` would force-move the branch ref regardless of whether `experiments` had moved between observation and action. If a parallel session shipped a commit to `experiments` in the gap between my `git reflog -15` read and the `git branch -f` write, the force-move would silently traverse that commit — the F-13 failure mode incarnate. `--ff-only` removes the traversal hazard by making git refuse to invent history; if `experiments` has moved, the merge errors out and the operator reconciles manually rather than discovering the loss later via reflog.

**Confirming data points:**
1. F-13 (2026-05-17, prior session) — `git reset --soft HEAD~1` erased a parallel session's T-13 commit because HEAD moved between observation and `reset` action. Recovered via reflog-quoted SHA. Driving incident for the existing CLAUDE.md § Concurrent-Work Rules block.
2. This session (2026-05-18) — F-5 detached-HEAD recovery used `git merge --ff-only a70816b5` after a single combined `reflog -15` read; experiments tip was `d5bf7116`, recovered-sha's parent was also `d5bf7116`, ff-only succeeded silently. Working tree clean, no data lost.

**Impact:** high. Concurrent-work git is the single most common silent-data-loss vector in multi-session work; `--ff-only` is one of the few git primitives that fails-loudly on stale-tip.

**Promote-when:** Two concretes reached (F-13 + F-5). Promote to CLAUDE.md § Concurrent-Work Rules with an explicit primitive callout: *"For detached-HEAD recovery, use `git checkout <branch> && git merge --ff-only <recovered-sha>` in one command. Never `git branch -f <branch> <recovered-sha>` — it traverses parallel commits silently."*

**Status:** promotion-eligible (criterion fires this session).
