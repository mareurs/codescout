## What's Built

See [`FEATURES.md`](FEATURES.md) for the full feature reference. Summary:

- **23 tools** across 6 categories (file, workflow, symbol, semantic, memory, config/nav)
- **LSP client** — transport, lifecycle, document symbols, references, definition, hover, rename + text sweep
- **Tree-sitter AST** — symbol extraction + docstrings for Rust, Python, TypeScript, Go, Java, Kotlin
- **Semantic search** — embedding pipeline with sqlite-vec ANN-indexed KNN, incremental rebuilds, drift detection ([concepts](manual/src/concepts/semantic-search.md), [backends](manual/src/configuration/embedding-backends.md))
- **Library search** — navigate third-party deps via LSP-inferred discovery, scoped symbol nav + semantic search
- **OutputBuffer** — `@cmd_*` / `@file_*` handles; large output stored, queried with Unix tools
- **run_command** — cwd, acknowledge_risk, dangerous-cmd speed bump, smart summaries per command type
- **read_file** — smart buffering with per-type summarizers; source files require symbol tools or start/end lines
- **Dual-audience output** — 8 tools emit structured JSON for agents + readable preview for humans
- **Progressive discoverability** — overflow responses include `by_file` breakdown + narrowing hints; `kind` filter
- **edit_file / remove_symbol** — find-and-replace and symbol deletion with security gating
- **Worktree write guard** — advisory `worktree_hint` field prevents silent cross-worktree corruption
- **Symbol signatures** — LSP `detail` field captured; `signature` synthesized for display
- **Project customization** — `.code-explorer/system-prompt.md` injects project-specific agent guidance
- **Onboarding** — language-specific nav hints, system-prompt draft generation
- **RecoverableError** — non-fatal tool failures don't abort sibling parallel calls
- **Dashboard** — `code-explorer dashboard` web UI with tool stats and project health ([concept page](manual/src/concepts/dashboard.md))
- **Companion Claude Code plugin** — `code-explorer-routing` for tool routing guidance (live at [mareurs/claude-plugins](https://github.com/mareurs/claude-plugins))
- **Usage monitor** — per-tool call stats in `usage.db`, surfaced via the dashboard
- **Git blame** via git2; persistent memory store (markdown topics)
- **MCP over stdio** (rmcp); 932 tests passing

## What's Next

- Additional tree-sitter grammars
- Additional LSP server configurations
- sqlite-vec integration for vector similarity (currently pure-Rust cosine — see [Semantic Search](manual/src/concepts/semantic-search.md))
- HTTP/SSE transport for non-Claude Code agents

## Future Improvements

Implemented features have been moved to [`FEATURES.md`](FEATURES.md).

### Multi-Agent Support (Generalize Beyond Claude Code)

Make code-explorer usable by any MCP-capable agent — Copilot, Cursor, Cline, custom agents — with routing knowledge included so agents know *when* to reach for each tool.

**Motivation:** The server already speaks MCP over stdio. The gap is that agents other than Claude Code lack the curated routing guidance (the `server_instructions.md` prompt) that tells Claude *how* to choose between `semantic_search`, `find_symbol`, `list_symbols`, etc. Without this, agents default to over-using a single tool (usually semantic search).

**Work streams:**

1. **HTTP/SSE transport** (already planned) — lets non-CLI agents connect without spawning a subprocess.

2. **Agent-neutral routing prompt** — refactor `server_instructions.md` into a well-structured decision tree that any agent can consume as a system prompt or tool description prefix. Avoid Claude-specific framing.

3. **`code-explorer-routing` plugin / extension** — a thin adapter per agent platform:
   - Claude Code: existing plugin approach
   - VS Code Copilot: Language Model Tools API (`vscode.lm.registerTool`)
   - Cursor: `.cursorrules` + MCP config
   - Generic: OpenAPI spec + routing hints as tool descriptions

4. **Tool description quality** — every tool's `description()` should embed just enough routing guidance to work even without a system prompt (one-sentence "prefer this over X when Y" hint).

5. **Benchmark routing quality** — extend the live benchmark to test tool selection accuracy across agent backends, not just result quality.

### Filesystem Watcher (Realtime Index Updates)

Background filesystem watcher for near-realtime index updates. **Depends on** Incremental Index Rebuilding (Layer 2 of that design).

**Motivation:** Layers 0+1 of incremental indexing cover commit-oriented workflows well, but some users want the index to stay current as they edit — especially in long coding sessions where commits are infrequent.

**Implementation sketch:**
- Use the `notify` crate (cross-platform: inotify on Linux, FSEvents on macOS, ReadDirectoryChangesW on Windows)
- Spawn a background `tokio::spawn` task in the MCP server on startup
- Debounce events with a 2s window to batch rapid saves
- Filter events through `.gitignore` + `ignored_paths` config
- Call `diff_and_reindex` with a per-file candidate list (no git diff needed — watcher knows exactly which files changed)
- Opt-in via `project.toml`: `[index] watch = true`

**Platform considerations:**
- Linux: `inotify` has a per-user watch limit (`fs.inotify.max_user_watches`), may need guidance for large repos
- macOS: `FSEvents` is directory-level, efficient for large trees
- Windows: `ReadDirectoryChangesW` works but has buffer overflow edge cases on burst writes
- The `notify` crate abstracts all of this, but platform-specific tuning docs may be needed

### Glossary & Documentation Management (Hash-Based Change Tracking)

Maintain project glossaries and documentation that stay in sync with the codebase via content-hash change detection.

**Motivation:** LLM-generated documentation (onboarding summaries, architecture glossaries, API docs) goes stale the moment the underlying code changes. Manual upkeep is unsustainable. By tracking file content hashes, code-explorer can detect *which* documented files changed, compute targeted diffs, and trigger glossary/documentation updates — keeping project knowledge accurate without full re-indexing.

**Core mechanism:**

1. **Hash tracking** — Store a content hash (e.g. SHA-256) for every file that contributes to a glossary or documentation entry. Persist in `.code-explorer/doc-hashes.db` (SQLite, same pattern as `embeddings.db`).

2. **Change detection** — On a `check_docs` or `sync_docs` tool call (or automatically during `onboarding`), compare stored hashes against current file content. Files with mismatched hashes are flagged as stale.

3. **Targeted diff** — For each stale file, compute a diff (reusing `git/diff` infra or direct content comparison). Surface only the *meaningful* changes (skip whitespace-only, comment-only changes via configurable filters).

4. **Update trigger** — Present the diffs to the LLM with the current glossary entry, prompting a targeted update rather than a full rewrite. Alternatively, for structured glossaries, apply rule-based updates (renamed symbol → rename in glossary).

**Glossary features:**
- **Term extraction** — Build a glossary from codebase symbols, domain concepts, and abbreviations (combining AST/LSP data with semantic search)
- **Cross-reference** — Link glossary terms to source locations (file:line), kept accurate via hash tracking
- **Scope** — Per-project glossary in `.code-explorer/glossary.md` or structured `.code-explorer/glossary.json`

**Documentation management features:**
- **Doc registration** — `register_doc(path, sources: [file globs])` links a documentation file to the source files it describes
- **Staleness report** — `check_docs()` tool returns which docs are stale, what changed, and suggested update scope
- **Auto-update** — `sync_docs(path)` re-generates or patches a specific doc using the diffs as context

**Storage schema (doc-hashes.db):**
```sql
CREATE TABLE doc_sources (
    doc_path    TEXT NOT NULL,     -- the documentation/glossary file
    source_path TEXT NOT NULL,     -- a source file it depends on
    hash        TEXT NOT NULL,     -- SHA-256 of source content at last sync
    synced_at   TEXT NOT NULL,     -- ISO 8601 timestamp
    PRIMARY KEY (doc_path, source_path)
);
```

**Implementation sketch:**
- New `src/tools/docs.rs` module with `register_doc`, `check_docs`, `sync_docs`, `build_glossary` tools
- `src/docs/` module for hash computation, staleness detection, diff generation
- Integration with existing memory store — glossary terms can cross-reference memory topics
- Progressive disclosure: `check_docs` in exploring mode shows only stale counts; focused mode shows full diffs

**Example workflow:**
1. Onboarding creates `glossary.md` with key terms and `architecture.md` summary
2. `register_doc("glossary.md", sources: ["src/**/*.rs"])` tracks all Rust source hashes
3. Developer adds a new tool module — hash changes detected on next `check_docs()`
4. LLM receives: "3 files changed since last sync" + targeted diffs → updates glossary with new tool's terms

### Interactive Sessions

Allow the agent to interact with long-running processes — REPLs, debuggers, and confirmation prompts — instead of waiting for them to exit.

**Motivation:** `run_command` currently blocks until the process exits. Commands like `python3 -i`, `pdb`, or `npm install` (with y/n prompts) hang until timeout. There is no way for the agent to send input to a running process.

**Design:** Three tools built on a `SessionStore` (analogous to `OutputBuffer`):

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `run_command(interactive: true)` | Spawns with piped I/O, waits for initial output to settle, returns a `@ses_<hex>` session handle |
| `session_send(session_id, input)` | Writes a line to stdin, waits for settle window of silence, returns the output delta |
| `session_cancel(session_id)` | Kills the process and frees all resources |

**Settle detection:** After each write, poll the output buffer every 10ms. When 150ms passes with no new bytes, the response is considered complete. Configurable via `settle_ms`. No prompt-pattern knowledge needed.

**Scope:** REPLs, debuggers, confirmation flows. Full-screen TUI apps (vim, less) are explicitly out of scope — no PTY allocation.

**Design doc:** [`plans/2026-03-01-interactive-sessions-design.md`](plans/2026-03-01-interactive-sessions-design.md)
**Implementation plan:** [`plans/2026-03-01-interactive-sessions-plan.md`](plans/2026-03-01-interactive-sessions-plan.md)

## Contributor Skills

Three Claude Code skills living in `.claude/skills/` within this repo. Contributors who open code-explorer in Claude Code get them automatically — no build step required. See [`plans/2026-02-26-contributor-skills-design.md`](plans/2026-02-26-contributor-skills-design.md) for the full design.

| Skill | Purpose | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `project-management` | Navigate sprint status, roadmap, open PRs and issues | Planned |
| `debugging` | Systematic debugging workflow for the Rust codebase | Planned |
| `log-stat-analyzer` | Analyze `usage.db` for call pattern drift and latency regressions | Ready |

### `project-management`

Surface current sprint status from the roadmap, map recent commits to sprint items, and guide contributors through opening correctly-structured PRs. Uses `run_command` with `git log`, `run_command` with `git diff`, and the GitHub MCP tools alongside `docs/ROADMAP.md` and `docs/plans/`.

### `debugging`

Systematic workflow from symptom to fix to verification — covering build failures, test failures, LSP timeouts, tree-sitter parse errors, and embedding pipeline issues. Guides contributors through hypothesis formation (`semantic_search`, `find_symbol`), targeted investigation (`run_command("git log/blame")`, `search_pattern`), and the `cargo build` / `cargo test` / `cargo clippy` verification loop.

### `log-stat-analyzer`

Structured workflow for interpreting Tool Usage Monitor data: per-tool call counts, error rates, p50/p99 latency, overflow rates, and time-bucketed drift detection. Produces actionable summaries (e.g. "semantic_search error rate up 3× in last 24h"). Uses the dashboard (`code-explorer dashboard`).
