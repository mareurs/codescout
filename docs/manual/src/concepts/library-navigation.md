# Library Navigation

Library navigation lets you explore third-party dependency source code using the
same symbol tools you use for your own project — `symbols`, `symbols`,
`symbol_at`, `semantic_search` — without switching contexts or manually
locating package directories.

## Auto-Discovery

Libraries are discovered automatically. When you call `symbol_at` on a
symbol and the LSP resolves it to a path *outside the project root* (typically
inside a language package cache), codescout registers that path as a library
and names it by the package name inferred from the manifest it finds there.

The next time you call `list_libraries`, the dependency appears in the list.
No manual registration is required for the common case.

## The Scope Parameter

Once a library is registered, pass `scope` to any navigation or search tool to
target it:

| Value | Searches |
|---|---|
| `"project"` (default) | Only your project's source code |
| `"lib:<name>"` | A specific registered library (e.g. `"lib:tokio"`) |
| `"libraries"` | All registered libraries combined |
| `"all"` | Your project + all registered libraries |

```json
{
  "tool": "semantic_search",
  "arguments": { "query": "retry with backoff", "scope": "lib:reqwest" }
}
```

Results include a `"source"` field so you can tell project code from library
code at a glance.

## Building a Library Index

Semantic search over library code requires an embedding index, just like project
code. Build one with `index_project` pointed at the library's root path:

```json
{ "tool": "index_project", "arguments": { "path": "/path/to/tokio-1.35.1/" } }
```

This is a one-time cost per library. The index persists in
`.codescout/embeddings/lib/<name>.db` — see
[Per-Library Embedding Databases](#per-library-embedding-databases) below.

## When to Use Library Navigation

- You're debugging an unfamiliar error from a dependency and want to read its
  source without leaving your session
- You want to understand how a library's internal types relate before writing
  integration code
- You're doing a security audit and want to trace a call chain into a dependency
- You want to find usage examples by searching the library's own tests with
  `semantic_search(scope: "lib:<name>")`

  `list_libraries` and library indexing

  the `scope` parameter

  library scope

## Per-Library Embedding Databases

Earlier versions stored all embeddings in a single `.codescout/embeddings.db`.
The current layout splits storage into separate databases:

```
.codescout/
  embeddings/
    project.db          ← your project's code
    lib/
      tokio.db          ← one file per registered library
      serde.db
      reqwest.db
```

The filename for each library is derived from its registered name: `/` and `\`
are replaced with `--` and the result is lowercased (e.g. `@org/pkg` →
`org--pkg.db`).

**Migration is automatic.** If an old `embeddings.db` is found, codescout moves
its contents into the new structure the first time the project is opened. No
manual steps required.

To build or rebuild a library's index:

```json
{ "tool": "index_project", "arguments": { "scope": "lib:tokio" } }
```

## Version Tracking and Staleness Hints

When `index_project(scope="lib:<name>")` runs, codescout reads the project's
lockfile (`Cargo.lock`, `package-lock.json`, etc.) to record the library version
that was indexed.

After a dependency upgrade, `semantic_search` includes a `stale_libraries` field:

```json
{
  "stale_libraries": [
    {
      "name": "tokio",
      "indexed": "1.37.0",
      "current": "1.38.0",
      "hint": "tokio was updated — run index_project(scope='lib:tokio') to re-index"
    }
  ]
}
```

Staleness is detected by comparing indexed vs current versions from the lockfile.
If the lockfile ecosystem is not recognised, version tracking is skipped.
