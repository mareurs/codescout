## MCP Server Issues

### "Tool not found" in Claude Code

The server is not registered in your MCP configuration.

**Fix:** Verify the server entry exists:

```bash
claude mcp list
```

You should see `codescout` listed as connected, with its tools available.
If it is missing, register it:

```bash
claude mcp add --global codescout -- codescout start --project .
```

See [Installation](getting-started/installation.md) for the full setup.

### Server starts but no tools appear

The project path is not set or points to a directory that does not exist.

**Fix:** Check the `--project` argument in your MCP configuration. The path
must be an absolute path to an existing directory, or `.` to use the current
working directory. Verify it resolves correctly:

```bash
codescout start --project /path/to/your/project
```

If you omit `--project`, codescout tries to auto-detect from the current
working directory. This works when Claude Code launches the server from within
a project, but can fail if the working directory is unexpected.

### "Connection refused" or server won't start

The binary is not installed, not on PATH, or (in HTTP mode) the port is
already in use.

**Fix:**

```bash
# Check the binary is installed
which codescout
codescout --version

# If not found, install it
cargo install codescout

# For HTTP mode, check port conflicts
lsof -i :8080
```

### Server crashes on startup

This usually means a required shared library is missing (common with the
`local-embed` feature, which needs ONNX Runtime as a native system library).

**Fix:** Check the error output on stderr. If it mentions `libonnxruntime`,
install ONNX Runtime on your system, or switch to Ollama (recommended) for
local-free embeddings without native dependencies:

```bash
# Rebuild using only the remote backend (supports Ollama, OpenAI, etc.)
git clone https://github.com/mareurs/codescout.git
cd codescout
cargo install --path . --no-default-features --features remote-embed
```

Then start Ollama and configure codescout to use it — see
[Ollama setup](../configuration/embedding-backends.md#ollama-default).

---

## LSP and Symbol Tools

### Symbol tools return empty results

The language server for that file's language is not installed or not on PATH.

**Fix:** Install the required language server and verify it is accessible:

```bash
# Rust
which rust-analyzer

# Python
which pyright-langserver

# TypeScript/JavaScript
which typescript-language-server

# Go
which gopls

# Java
which jdtls

# Kotlin
which kotlin-language-server

# C/C++
which clangd

# C#
which OmniSharp

# Ruby
which solargraph
```

See the [Language Support](language-support.md) page for the full list.

**Also:** The language server may still be initializing. This is especially
common with `jdtls` (Java) and `kotlin-language-server`, which can take 10-30
seconds on first startup while they index the project. Wait a few seconds and
retry the tool call.

### "No tree-sitter grammar for 'X'"

A tree-sitter grammar was requested for a language that does not have one bundled.

**Fix:** Use LSP-based tools instead. `symbols` provides similar
information (file structure, symbol names and kinds) and works for all 9 LSP
languages.

If the language is not supported at all, only file operations and semantic
search (after indexing) are available.

### `references` returns nothing

Two common causes:

1. **Language server not fully indexed.** Some LSP servers need to scan the
   entire project before they can answer reference queries. This is especially
   true for Java (`jdtls`), which builds a workspace model at startup. Wait
   for initialization to complete and retry.

2. **Symbol has no references.** The symbol genuinely is not referenced
   anywhere in the project. This is correct behavior for unused code.

### Symbol tools work for some files but not others

The file's language may not be recognized, or the language server may have
crashed on that specific file.

**Fix:** Check the server logs (stderr) for error messages from the language
server. Restart the MCP server to reset all language server processes. If the
problem persists with a specific file, the file may contain syntax errors that
the language server cannot parse.

---

## Semantic Search

### "No results" from `semantic_search`

The embedding index has not been built for this project.

**Fix:** Build the index, then verify:

```json
{ "tool": "index", "arguments": { "action": "build" } }
{ "tool": "workspace", "arguments": { "action": "status" } }
```

`workspace(action: status)` shows the number of indexed files and chunks. If both are zero,
the index build failed -- check server logs for errors.

### "Connection refused" when indexing

The default embedding backend is Ollama, which must be running locally.

**Fix:**

```bash
# Start Ollama
ollama serve

# Verify it's running
curl http://localhost:11434/v1/embeddings \
  -d '{"model": "mxbai-embed-large", "input": "test"}'
```

If you do not want to run Ollama, switch to a different backend. See
[Embedding Backends](configuration/embedding-backends.md).

### "Model not found" when indexing

The configured embedding model has not been pulled into Ollama.

**Fix:**

```bash
ollama pull mxbai-embed-large
```

Or if you configured a different model in `project.toml`:

```bash
ollama pull <your-model-name>
```

### Results seem wrong or irrelevant after changing the model

The index was built with a different embedding model. Vectors from different
models are incompatible -- mixing them produces meaningless similarity scores.

**Fix:** Rebuild the index from scratch:

```json
{ "tool": "index", "arguments": { "action": "build", "force": true } }
```

Then verify the models match:

```json
{ "tool": "workspace", "arguments": { "action": "status" } }
```

The response includes `configured_model` and `indexed_with_model`. They must
be the same.

### Indexing is very slow

Embedding large codebases with Ollama on CPU can take minutes or longer.

**Fix (pick one):**

- **Use a faster backend.** `openai:text-embedding-3-small` is significantly
  faster than local Ollama for large projects.
- **Reduce scope.** Add build artifacts, vendored code, and generated files to
  `ignored_paths` in `project.toml` so they are skipped during indexing.
- **Use GPU.** If Ollama has GPU access, embedding is much faster. Check
  `ollama ps` to verify the model is loaded on GPU.

### "No embedding backend compiled in"

The binary was built with `--no-default-features` and no embedding feature
was enabled.

**Fix:** Reinstall with an embedding backend:

```bash
# Remote backend — supports Ollama (recommended), OpenAI, and compatible servers
cargo install codescout --features remote-embed

# Local CPU backend — requires building from source (not available via crates.io)
git clone https://github.com/mareurs/codescout.git
cd codescout
cargo install --path . --features local-embed
```

> **Tip:** For a free, local setup without building from source, use
> [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) with the default `remote-embed` binary.
> See [Embedding Backends](../configuration/embedding-backends.md#ollama-default).

## Configuration

### Changes to `project.toml` not taking effect

Configuration is loaded when a project is activated. Editing the file after
activation does not automatically reload it.

**Fix:** Call `workspace(action: activate)` again to reload the configuration:

```json
{ "tool": "workspace", "arguments": { "action": "activate", "path": "/path/to/project" } }
```

Or restart the MCP server.

### "No active project" errors

The server was started without a `--project` flag and could not auto-detect
a project from the working directory.

**Fix:** Set the project explicitly:

```json
{ "tool": "workspace", "arguments": { "action": "activate", "path": "/path/to/project" } }
```

Or restart the server with `--project`:

```bash
codescout start --project /path/to/project
```

## File Operations

> For a full explanation of the permission model, see [Security & Permissions](concepts/security.md).

### "Permission denied" or "Access denied" reading a file

The file is in the built-in, non-configurable deny list.

The built-in deny list blocks access to sensitive locations regardless of
configuration:

```
~/.ssh
~/.aws
~/.gnupg
~/.config/gcloud
~/.config/gh
~/.docker/config.json
~/.netrc
~/.npmrc
~/.kube/config
```

On Linux, `/etc/shadow` and `/etc/gshadow` are also blocked. On macOS,
`/etc/master.passwd` is blocked.

**Fix:** This is intentional security behavior and the list is not
configurable. If you genuinely need unrestricted absolute-path reads, set
`profile = "root"` in `project.toml` — this disables the deny-list check
entirely rather than allowlisting one path. See [Project
Configuration](configuration/project-toml.md) for details.

### "Access denied" writing a file outside the project

File write tools are restricted to the project root by default.

**Fix:** Add the target directory to `extra_write_roots` in `project.toml`:

```toml
[security]
extra_write_roots = ["/path/to/other/directory"]
```

### Shell commands return "shell execution is disabled"

`shell_command_mode` is set to `"disabled"`, which blocks every `run_command` call.

**Fix:** Set the mode to `"warn"` (the default) or `"unrestricted"` in `project.toml`:

```toml
[security]
shell_command_mode = "warn"   # or "unrestricted"
```

`shell_command_mode` controls `run_command`: `"warn"` (the default) and `"unrestricted"`
both run commands normally; `"disabled"` blocks all shell calls.

---

## Git Tools

### Git tools return errors

Two common causes:

1. **Not a git repository.** The project root does not contain a `.git`
   directory.

   **Fix:** Verify with `ls -la /path/to/project/.git`. If the project is not
   a git repo, git tools will not work.

---

## Performance

### Slow responses on first tool call for a language

The first symbol tool call for a given language starts the language server
process. Startup time varies:

| Server | Typical startup |
|--------|-----------------|
| `rust-analyzer` | 2-5 seconds |
| `pyright-langserver` | 1-3 seconds |
| `typescript-language-server` | 1-2 seconds |
| `gopls` | 1-3 seconds |
| `clangd` | 1-2 seconds |
| `jdtls` | 10-30 seconds |
| `kotlin-language-server` | 5-15 seconds |

**Fix:** This is expected. Subsequent calls are fast because the server stays
running. If startup time is a problem for Java or Kotlin, use `grep`
or `semantic_search` for initial exploration — they have no startup delay.

### Large project causes tool timeouts

The default tool timeout is 60 seconds. Operations on very large projects
(indexing, initial LSP workspace scan) can exceed this.

**Fix:** Increase the timeout in `project.toml`:

```toml
[project]
tool_timeout_secs = 120
```

### High memory usage

Language servers can use significant memory, especially `jdtls` and
`rust-analyzer` on large projects. Running multiple language servers
simultaneously compounds this.

**Fix:** codescout starts language servers on demand, so only languages
you actively use consume memory. When the MCP server exits (or receives
SIGINT/SIGTERM), it gracefully shuts down all language servers via the LSP
shutdown protocol. As a safety net, the `LspClient` Drop implementation also
sends SIGTERM to child processes, ensuring cleanup even on abrupt exits.

If you have multiple Claude Code sessions, each spawns its own codescout
process with its own language servers. Close unused sessions to reclaim
memory.

## Getting Help

If none of the above resolves your issue:

1. **Check server logs.** codescout logs to stderr. In stdio mode, Claude
   Code captures this; look in Claude Code's MCP server logs. In HTTP mode,
   stderr goes to the terminal where you started the server.

2. **Enable debug logging.** Set `RUST_LOG=debug` for verbose output:

   ```bash
   RUST_LOG=debug codescout start --project /path/to/project
   ```

   This shows every tool call, LSP message, and embedding operation.

3. **Check the configuration.** Use the `workspace` tool to see the
   active configuration as the server sees it:

   ```json
   { "tool": "workspace", "arguments": { "action": "status" } }
   ```

4. **File an issue.** Open a GitHub issue with:
   - The error message (exact text)
   - The tool call that triggered it
   - Your `project.toml` (redact any secrets)
   - Output from `RUST_LOG=debug` if available
