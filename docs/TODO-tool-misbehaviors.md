# Tool Misbehaviors — Observed in the Wild

This is a living document. **Update it whenever you observe unexpected, wrong, or dangerous
behavior from code-explorer's own tools while working on the codebase.** Each entry should
capture: what you did, what you expected, what actually happened, and a reproduction hint.

## Observed Bugs

### BUG-001 — `edit_lines` blind editing causes wrong-line mistakes

**Date:** 2026-02-28
**Severity:** High — silently corrupts the file
**Status:** ✅ FIXED — `expected_content` guard added (commit `e03bce7`)

**What happened:**
Wanted to replace `project_explicitly_activated: false,` (line 56) with a variable binding.
Used `edit_lines(start_line=55, delete_count=1, ...)` but line 55 was `active_project,` —
the line above the intended target. The tool replaced the wrong line without any warning,
producing a duplicate `Ok(Self {` block and two compiler errors.

**Root cause:**
`edit_lines` has no way to confirm what's at the target line before applying the edit.
There is no `old_content` parameter (unlike the builtin `Edit` tool's `old_string`), so
a one-off line count error causes silent corruption.

**Fix applied:**
Added optional `expected_content: String` guard — if line N doesn't match, returns a
`RecoverableError` instead of applying the edit.

### BUG-002 — `rename_symbol` LSP rename corrupts unrelated code

**Date:** 2026-02-28
**Severity:** High — produces unparseable source
**Status:** Open

**What happened:**
Renamed test function `project_not_explicitly_activated_on_startup` →
`project_not_explicitly_activated_without_project`. The tool reported success with
`textual_match_count: 0` (meaning the textual sweep found nothing extra), but line ~387
in `agent.rs` was corrupted to:

```
asserproject_not_explicitly_activated_without_project("From file\n"));
```

The LSP rename itself (not the textual sweep) made a bad substitution inside unrelated code,
producing a file that fails to compile with "mismatched closing delimiter" errors.

**Reproduction hint:**
The corrupted line was inside the `project_status_file_takes_precedence_over_toml` test
(lines ~369–384 before the rename). The original line was likely an `assert_eq!` or
similar that the LSP matched as a reference to the renamed symbol — possibly because
rust-analyzer's rename heuristic matched a substring of the function name within a
string literal or doc comment.

**Root cause hypothesis:**
rust-analyzer's rename may have matched a string literal or comment containing the old
function name as a substring. Or the `rename_symbol` tool's textual sweep regex is too
broad and matched a partial occurrence the tool incorrectly reported as 0.

**Fix ideas:**
- After any `rename_symbol` call, immediately run `cargo build` or at least
  `search_pattern` to verify the file is still valid.
- Add a post-rename compilation check in the tool itself (or in the server instructions).
- Investigate whether rust-analyzer's rename is at fault or whether the textual sweep
  regex needs word-boundary anchors (`\b`).
- Consider showing a diff preview before applying rename in destructive mode.

### BUG-003 — `replace_symbol` eats closing `}` of preceding method

**Date:** 2026-02-28
**Severity:** High — silently corrupts the file
**Status:** ✅ FIXED — Two root causes identified and resolved. Regression tests:
`tests/symbol_lsp.rs::replace_symbol_preserves_preceding_close_brace`,
`tests/symbol_lsp.rs::replace_symbol_preserves_paren_close_brace`.

**What happened:**
Called `replace_symbol` on `impl Tool for EditLines/input_schema`. The LSP's symbol range
for `input_schema` apparently included the closing `    }` and blank line of the *preceding*
`description` method. My replacement body started with `fn input_schema...` (without that
`    }` prefix), so the description method lost its closing brace — making it span into
`input_schema` and beyond in the compiler's view.

**Root cause (two components):**
1. `trim_symbol_start` originally only skipped exact `}`, `},`, `};` strings but not
   variants like `})` (closing a `json!({...})` macro) or `} // comment`. If the LSP
   placed `start_line` at such a line, the preceding method's closing tokens were deleted.
   **Fixed:** changed check to `t.starts_with('}')` — catches all closing-brace variants.
2. Stale LSP cache: after a first `replace_symbol` write, the LSP wasn't notified of the
   change, so a second call on the same file used stale line numbers, causing wrong splices.
   **Fixed:** `ctx.lsp.notify_file_changed(&full_path)` called after every `write_lines`
   (via `LspManager::notify_file_changed` → `did_change` on each active client).

**Reproduction hint:**
The `})` blind spot: a preceding method that ends with `json!({...})` — the `})` line
caused `trim_symbol_start` to stop rather than skip. The stale-cache case: two consecutive
`replace_symbol` calls on the same file without a `notify_file_changed` in between.

**Fix applied:**
`trim_symbol_start` now uses `t.starts_with('}')` to skip any closing-brace variant.
Applied in both `replace_symbol::call` and `insert_code::call` ("before" case).
`notify_file_changed` notifies all active LSP clients after every `write_lines`.

### BUG-004 — `insert_code` inserts inside a function body instead of after it

**Date:** 2026-02-28
**Severity:** High — silently corrupts the file
**Status:** ✅ PARTIALLY FIXED — `trim_symbol_start` applied to the "before" case. Regression tests: `tests/symbol_lsp.rs::insert_code_before_skips_lead_in`. The "after" case (using `end_line`) is not yet protected.

**What happened:**
Called `insert_code(name_path="tests/edit_lines_missing_params_errors", position="after")`.
The insertion was placed *inside* `edit_lines_delete_past_eof_errors` — inside its
`json!({...})` body — rather than after `edit_lines_missing_params_errors`.

**Root cause hypothesis:**
The LSP symbol range for `edit_lines_missing_params_errors` apparently ends at a line that
is *within* a neighboring (likely the next) function. `insert_code` uses the `end_line` of
the symbol to determine the insertion point, but the `end_line` was stale or incorrect.
Could also be a name-path resolution issue — the tool may have matched the wrong function.

**Fix ideas:**
- After `insert_code`, verify the insertion with `search_pattern` to confirm the new code
  is in the expected location.
- Consider using `edit_lines` for insertions when position must be precise.
- For the "after" case: similarly apply a `trim_symbol_end` that scans backwards from
  `end_line` to find the actual closing token, guarding against over-extended LSP ranges.
