# Tool Misbehaviors — Observed in the Wild

This is a living document. **Update it whenever you observe unexpected, wrong, or dangerous
behavior from code-explorer's own tools while working on the codebase.** Each entry should

## Observed Bugs

### BUG-001 — `edit_lines` blind editing causes wrong-line mistakes

**Date:** 2026-02-28
**Severity:** High — silently corrupts the file
**Status:** ✅ SUPERSEDED — `edit_lines` removed; replaced by `edit_file` (old_string/new_string)

**What happened:**
Wanted to replace `project_explicitly_activated: false,` (line 56) with a variable binding.
Used `edit_lines(start_line=55, delete_count=1, ...)` but line 55 was `active_project,` —
the line above the intended target. The tool replaced the wrong line without any warning,
producing a duplicate `Ok(Self {` block and two compiler errors.

**Root cause:**
`edit_lines` has no way to confirm what's at the target line before applying the edit.
There is no `old_content` parameter (unlike the builtin `Edit` tool's `old_string`), so
a one-off line count error causes silent corruption.

**Fix applied:**
Added optional `expected_content: String` guard — if line N doesn't match, returns a
`RecoverableError` instead of applying the edit.

### BUG-002 — `rename_symbol` LSP rename corrupts unrelated code

**Date:** 2026-02-28
**Severity:** High — produces unparseable source
**Status:** ✅ FIXED — UTF-16 → byte offset corrected in `apply_text_edits`; post-rename
corruption scan added to detect wrong-column edits from the LSP.

**What happened:**
Renamed test function `project_not_explicitly_activated_on_startup` →
`project_not_explicitly_activated_without_project`. The tool reported success with
`textual_match_count: 0` (meaning the textual sweep found nothing extra), but line ~387
in `agent.rs` was corrupted to:

```
asserproject_not_explicitly_activated_without_project("From file\n"));
```

The LSP rename itself (not the textual sweep) made a bad substitution inside unrelated code,
producing a file that fails to compile with "mismatched closing delimiter" errors.

**Reproduction hint:**
The corrupted line was inside the `project_status_file_takes_precedence_over_toml` test
(lines ~369–384 before the rename). The original line was likely an `assert_eq!` or
similar that the LSP matched as a reference to the renamed symbol — possibly because
rust-analyzer's rename heuristic matched a substring of the function name within a
string literal or doc comment.

**Root cause hypothesis:**
rust-analyzer's rename may have matched a string literal or comment containing the old
function name as a substring. Or the `rename_symbol` tool's textual sweep regex is too
broad and matched a partial occurrence the tool incorrectly reported as 0.

**Fix ideas:**
- After any `rename_symbol` call, immediately run `cargo build` or at least
  `search_pattern` to verify the file is still valid.
- Add a post-rename compilation check in the tool itself (or in the server instructions).
- Investigate whether rust-analyzer's rename is at fault or whether the textual sweep
  regex needs word-boundary anchors (`\b`).
- Consider showing a diff preview before applying rename in destructive mode.

### BUG-003 — `replace_symbol` eats closing `}` of preceding method

**Date:** 2026-02-28
**Severity:** High — silently corrupts the file
**Status:** ✅ FIXED — Two root causes identified and resolved. Regression tests:
`tests/symbol_lsp.rs::replace_symbol_preserves_preceding_close_brace`,
`tests/symbol_lsp.rs::replace_symbol_preserves_paren_close_brace`.

**What happened:**
Called `replace_symbol` on `impl Tool for EditLines/input_schema`. The LSP's symbol range
for `input_schema` apparently included the closing `    }` and blank line of the *preceding*
`description` method. My replacement body started with `fn input_schema...` (without that
`    }` prefix), so the description method lost its closing brace — making it span into
`input_schema` and beyond in the compiler's view.

**Root cause (two components):**
1. `trim_symbol_start` originally only skipped exact `}`, `},`, `};` strings but not
   variants like `})` (closing a `json!({...})` macro) or `} // comment`. If the LSP
   placed `start_line` at such a line, the preceding method's closing tokens were deleted.
   **Fixed:** changed check to `t.starts_with('}')` — catches all closing-brace variants.
2. Stale LSP cache: after a first `replace_symbol` write, the LSP wasn't notified of the
   change, so a second call on the same file used stale line numbers, causing wrong splices.
   **Fixed:** `ctx.lsp.notify_file_changed(&full_path)` called after every `write_lines`
   (via `LspManager::notify_file_changed` → `did_change` on each active client).

**Reproduction hint:**
The `})` blind spot: a preceding method that ends with `json!({...})` — the `})` line
caused `trim_symbol_start` to stop rather than skip. The stale-cache case: two consecutive
`replace_symbol` calls on the same file without a `notify_file_changed` in between.

**Fix applied:**
`trim_symbol_start` now uses `t.starts_with('}')` to skip any closing-brace variant.
Applied in both `replace_symbol::call` and `insert_code::call` ("before" case).
`notify_file_changed` notifies all active LSP clients after every `write_lines`.

### BUG-004 — `insert_code` inserts inside a function body instead of after it

**Date:** 2026-02-28
**Severity:** High — silently corrupts the file
**Status:** ✅ FIXED — `trim_symbol_start` for "before"; `trim_symbol_end` for "after".
Regression tests: `tests/symbol_lsp.rs::insert_code_before_skips_lead_in`,
`tests/symbol_lsp.rs::insert_code_after_skips_trail_in`.

**What happened:**
Called `insert_code(name_path="tests/edit_lines_missing_params_errors", position="after")`.
The insertion was placed *inside* `edit_lines_delete_past_eof_errors` — inside its
`json!({...})` body — rather than after `edit_lines_missing_params_errors`.

**Root cause:**
LSP over-extends a symbol's `end_line` to include the opening line of the following symbol
(`fn following() {`). `insert_code` used `end_line + 1` directly, landing inside the
following function's body.

**Fix applied:**
Added `trim_symbol_end` (symmetric to `trim_symbol_start`) that walks backward from
`end_line` past lines ending with `{` (next symbol's opening) and blank lines, stopping at
the current symbol's own closing `}`. Applied in the "after" branch of `InsertCode::call`.

### BUG-005 — `read_file`: directory path returns hard error instead of RecoverableError

**Date:** 2026-03-01
**Severity:** Medium — aborts parallel tool calls in Claude Code
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

**What happened:**
Called `read_file(path: "src/config")` where `src/config` is a directory. Got:
`Error: failed to read …/src/config: Is a directory (os error 21)` — a hard `anyhow`
error. Claude Code treats `isError: true` responses as fatal, aborting sibling parallel
calls. Should have been a `RecoverableError` with a hint to use `list_dir` instead.

**Root cause:**
The `map_err` on `std::fs::read_to_string` only converts `InvalidData` (binary file) to
`RecoverableError`; all other IO errors fell through to `anyhow::anyhow!()`. No pre-check
for `is_dir()` or `NotFound` was in place.

**Fix applied:**
Added `is_dir()` guard before `read_to_string`. Also converted `NotFound` to
`RecoverableError` in the `map_err` closure.

### BUG-006 — `index_status` / `index_project`: second call fails with shadow-table conflict

**Date:** 2026-03-01
**Severity:** High — `index_status` crashes on every call after the first post-indexing call
**Status:** ✅ FIXED — `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` + re-check in `maybe_migrate_to_vec0`;
`open_db` after `build_index` wrapped in `spawn_blocking`. Regression tests:
`migration_race_loser_exposes_shadow_table_conflict`,
`concurrent_open_db_migrations_do_not_corrupt`.

**What happened:**
First `index_status` call after `index_project` succeeds. Every subsequent call returned:
`"Could not create '_info' shadow table: table 'chunk_embeddings_info' already exists"`.

**Root cause:**
Classic TOCTOU (time-of-check / time-of-use) race in `maybe_migrate_to_vec0`:

1. `build_index` completes; `embedding_dims` is now set in `meta`; plain `chunk_embeddings`
   holds BLOB data.
2. `IndexProject`'s background `tokio::spawn` calls `open_db` **directly on the async
   thread** (no `spawn_blocking`) to read post-index stats — this is connection A.
3. `index_status` is called concurrently; its `spawn_blocking` calls `open_db` — this is
   connection B.
4. Both connections read `sqlite_master` *outside any transaction* and both observe
   `"plain table"`.
5. Connection A enters `BEGIN` (deferred), gets write lock, migrates plain → vec0,
   commits.  Shadow tables `chunk_embeddings_info` etc. are now live.
6. Connection B enters `BEGIN` (deferred), gets write lock.  B's view sees vec0 now.
   B runs `ALTER TABLE chunk_embeddings RENAME TO chunk_embeddings_v1` — SQLite allows
   renaming a virtual table since 3.26.0, **but does NOT rename shadow tables**.
   `chunk_embeddings_info` remains under its original name.
   B then runs `CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE chunk_embeddings USING vec0(...)` — fails with
   `"table 'chunk_embeddings_info' already exists"`.

**Fix applied:**
- `maybe_migrate_to_vec0`: changed `BEGIN` → `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` so only one connection
  can be attempting migration at a time.  Added a re-check inside the exclusive
  transaction: if the table is already vec0, ROLLBACK and return `Ok(())`.
- `IndexProject::call`: wrapped post-build `open_db` stats call in
  `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` so it runs on a dedicated thread and the async runtime
  is not blocked.  Also restructured to gather stats before acquiring the `Mutex` guard
  (a `MutexGuard` is `!Send` and cannot be held across an `.await`).
